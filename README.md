Experimental tool to downgrade an NGU Idle save from v1.260 (Steam) to v1.220 (Kongregate).

Currently, this is just a simple command line tool with no UI. However, you can drag/drop a save file onto the executable.

The downgraded file will have `(kong)` appended to the filename and written back to the same folder as the original save.

There is no installation, just download the `nguSteamToKong.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jshepler/nguSteamToKong/releases/latest) and extract the 3 files wherever you want. For ease of use, maybe extract them to where the saves are: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\NGU Industries\NGU Idle`
